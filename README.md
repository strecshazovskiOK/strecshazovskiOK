# 👋 Hi, I’m Ömercan Kahveci

- 💻 I’m a senior Computer Engineering student at METU, passionate about Embedded Systems, AI, and R&D.
- 🔬 I’m currently working on smart systems that combine hardware (Jetson Nano, Arduino) with machine learning models for real-time energy consumption and generation forecasting using LSTM and Transformers.
- 🧠 I build AI-powered applications using Python, JavaScript (Next.js, Node.js), and integrate them with MongoDB, Redis, and various ML/NLP models.
- 🛠️ Technical skills: Python, C/C++, Java, SQL, Flutter, PLC (Mach3 control), PyTorch, React Native, Flask, FastAPI, Docker.
- 🤖 I've built chatbots, forecasting systems, and IoT prototypes for smart homes, agriculture, and tourism sector projects.
- 📚 Currently learning: lightweight edge-device NLP models for AI assistant enhancement.
- 🌐 Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/strecshazovski/)
- 🎨 Fun fact: I enjoy photo manipulation and digital art with Photoshop.
